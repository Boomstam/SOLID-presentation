SOLID Design principles


=> Introduced by 'Uncle Bob'; the nickname of software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin in 2000.
Has many interesting (free) videos/podcast available, bv on SOLID: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHiWqnTWsn4.
He is also the person that coined the term 'clean code'.


=> Set of ideas/principles/design patterns that help to create maintainable, 'clean' code.

The Single-responsibility principle:
"There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."
In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.

The Openâ€“closed principle:
"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

The Liskov substitution principle:
"Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."

The Interface segregation principle:
"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

The Dependency inversion principle:
"Depend upon abstractions, not concretions."

=> Also useful as an way to find 'code smells', any violation of the principles is in itself a code smell.
